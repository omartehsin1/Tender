			'These are the ultimate steakhouse burgers. They are packed with flavor and reliably juicy, even when cooked to well-done.',
		recipe: "\n\n2 pieces white sandwich bread, crusts removed and cut into 1/4-inch pieces\n\n1/3 cup milk\n\n2-1/2 teaspoons kosher salt\n\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n3 garlic cloves, minced\n\n1-1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce\n\n2 tablespoons ketchup\n\n3 pounds 85% lean ground beef\n\n3 scallions, very finely sliced (optional)\n\n8 hamburger buns",
		instructions: "\n\nPreheat the grill to high heat.\n\nIn a large bowl, mash the bread and milk together with a fork until it forms a chunky paste.\n\nAdd the salt, pepper, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and ketchup and mix well.\n\nAdd the ground beef and scallions and break the meat up with your hands.\n\nMix everything together until just combined.\n\nDivide the mixture into 8 equal portions and form balls.\n\nFlatten the balls into 3/4-inch patties about 4-1/2 inches across.\n\nForm a slight depression in the center of each patty to prevent the burgers from puffing up on the grill.\n\nOil the grilling grates. Grill the burgers, covered, until nicely browned on the first side, 2 to 4 minutes.\n\nFlip burgers and continue cooking for a few minutes more until desired doneness is reached.\n\nBefore serving, toast the buns on the cooler side of the grill if desired.\n\nFreezer-Friendly Instructions: The uncooked burgers can be frozen for up to three months. (Freeze the burgers on a baking sheet or plate so their shape sets, then transfer them to a sealable plastic bag for easy storage.)\n\nDefrost the burgers overnight in the refrigerator prior to serving and then cook as directed.",

		description:
			'Filled with sausage, eggs, cheese and fresh avocado salsa, these bodega-style breakfast burritos are delish any time of day!',
		recipe: "\n\nFOR THE AVOCADO-TOMATO SALSA\n\n1 large avocado, peeled, pitted, and diced\n\n1/2 cup diced seeded tomatoes, from 1 to 2 tomatoes\n\n1 small shallot, minced (about 2 tablespoons)\n\n1 clove garlic, minced\n\n1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced\n\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, from 1 lime\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground cumin\n\n1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro\n\nFOR THE BURRITOS\n\n4 large eggs\n\n1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika\n\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 lb spicy sausage (such as chorizo, Italian, or anything you like), removed from casings\n\n1-1/3 cups (6 oz) shredded Monterey Jack cheese\n\n4 (10-in) burrito-size flour tortillas\n\nVegetable oil", 
		instructions: "\n\nMake the Avocado-Tomato Salsa: Place all of the ingredients in a medium bowl and mix to combine. Set aside.\n\nIn a medium bowl, whisk the eggs with the smoked paprika and salt. Set aside.\n\nHeat a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage from the pan to a plate, leaving the drippings in the pan. Reduce the heat to low. Add the eggs and scramble until just cooked through. Transfer the eggs to a plate. Clean the pan (you'll use it again).\n\nAssemble the burritos: Spoon about 1/4 cup of the avocado-salsa onto each tortilla (you'll have a little leftover salsa; that's for the cook!), followed by a quarter of the sausage, a quarter of the eggs, and 1/3 cup cheese. Fold in the sides of the tortilla over the filling and roll, tucking in the edges as you go.\n\nLightly coat the pan with oil and set over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the burritos over and continue cooking, covered, until golden, a few minutes more. Serve warm.\n\nMake Ahead: The burritos may be assembled a few hours ahead of time, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated, before cooking. To reheat leftover burritos, wrap in foil and warm in a 350°F oven for about 15 minutes. (They won't be as crisp as they are fresh out of the pan, but they reheat well.)",

		name: 'Margherita Pizza',
		description:
			'With a crisp yet chewy crust, this homemade Margherita pizza will rival your favorite pizzeria.',
		recipe: "\n\n1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, preferably San Marzano\n\n3 medium garlic cloves, minced\n\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 teaspoon sugar\n\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\nFlour, for stretching the dough\n\n2 (12-oz) homemade pizza doughs\n\n8 oz fresh mozzarella, not packed in water, cubed\n\n1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\n\n1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh basil, lightly packed\n\n1 tablespoon cornmeal, for baking", 
		instructions: "\n\nMake the Sauce: In a medium bowl, stir together the tomatoes, garlic, salt, sugar, pepper, and oil. (Alternatively, for a completely smooth sauce, you can blend the ingredients in a small food processor or blender.)\n\nPreheat the oven to 500°F and set an oven rack in the bottom position. Dust a 13x18-inch baking sheet with half of the cornmeal.\n\nOn a lightly floured surface, using your hands, stretch and press one ball of dough into an 11-inch round. Transfer the dough to the cornmeal-dusted baking sheet, and gently stretch it out again so that it maintains its shape.\n\nSpread ¼ cup + 2 tablespoons of the sauce over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Slide the baking sheet into the oven and bake for 7 minutes, until the crust is partially cooked. Remove from the oven, and scatter half of the mozzarella cubes over the sauce, followed by half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Slide the pan back into the oven and cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 4 minutes more. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Sprinkle with the basil and slice. Repeat with the remaining pizza dough and ingredients. (If you'd like to bake the two pizzas at the same time, you can fire up two ovens. Or, if you don't mind the crust a little thicker, you can form the two dough balls into 8x12-inch rectangles and place them side by side on the baking sheet.)\n\nNote: This recipe makes enough sauce for 4 (11-inch) pizzas. Refrigerate extra sauce for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 3 months.",

		name: 'Big Italian Salad',
		description:
			'This Italian salad pairs nicely with Italian comfort food. You’ll love the homemade dressing!',
		recipe: "\n\nFOR THE VINAIGRETTE\n\n1 cup loosely packed fresh Italian parsley leaves\n\n1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves\n\n1/4 teaspoon dried oregano\n\n2 cloves garlic, peeled\n\n1/4 cup red wine vinegar, best quality such as Pompeian Gourmet\n\n3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, best quality such as Lucini or Colavita\n\nHeaping 3/4 teaspoon salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n\n1-1/2 teaspoons honey\n\nFOR THE SALAD\n\n1 large head romaine lettuce (or 3 hearts), washed, dried and cut into large, bite-sized pieces\n\n1 large red bell pepper, chopped\n\n1 cup seeded and chopped hothouse cucumbers\n\n1 to 2 carrots, peeled into ribbons\n\nHandful grape tomatoes, halved\n\nHandful pitted olives\n\nRicotta Salata (see note) or Feta, crumbled to taste", 
		instructions: "\n\nMake the dressing: Combine all dressing ingredients in a food processor and blitz to blend.\n\nPlace all of the salad ingredients except for the cheese in a large bowl. Right before serving, add about half of the dressing and toss well. Add more dressing little by little as necessary; be sure to dress greens very generously, otherwise salad will be bland. Toss in the cheese, then taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.\n\nNote: Ricotta salata is an Italian sheep's milk cheese that has a salty, slightly tangy flavor, almost like a dry Italian feta. It is not the same as the wet ricotta in the tub. You can find it at Whole Foods, gourmet grocers or specialty cheese shops.",

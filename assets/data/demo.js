			'These are the ultimate steakhouse burgers. They are packed with flavor and reliably juicy, even when cooked to well-done.',
		recipe: "\n\n2 pieces white sandwich bread, crusts removed and cut into 1/4-inch pieces\n\n1/3 cup milk\n\n2-1/2 teaspoons kosher salt\n\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n3 garlic cloves, minced\n\n1-1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce\n\n2 tablespoons ketchup\n\n3 pounds 85% lean ground beef\n\n3 scallions, very finely sliced (optional)\n\n8 hamburger buns",
		instructions: "\n\nPreheat the grill to high heat.\n\nIn a large bowl, mash the bread and milk together with a fork until it forms a chunky paste.\n\nAdd the salt, pepper, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and ketchup and mix well.\n\nAdd the ground beef and scallions and break the meat up with your hands.\n\nMix everything together until just combined.\n\nDivide the mixture into 8 equal portions and form balls.\n\nFlatten the balls into 3/4-inch patties about 4-1/2 inches across.\n\nForm a slight depression in the center of each patty to prevent the burgers from puffing up on the grill.\n\nOil the grilling grates. Grill the burgers, covered, until nicely browned on the first side, 2 to 4 minutes.\n\nFlip burgers and continue cooking for a few minutes more until desired doneness is reached.\n\nBefore serving, toast the buns on the cooler side of the grill if desired.\n\nFreezer-Friendly Instructions: The uncooked burgers can be frozen for up to three months. (Freeze the burgers on a baking sheet or plate so their shape sets, then transfer them to a sealable plastic bag for easy storage.)\n\nDefrost the burgers overnight in the refrigerator prior to serving and then cook as directed.",

			'Filled with sausage, eggs, cheese and fresh avocado salsa, these bodega-style breakfast burritos are delish any time of day!',
		recipe: "\n\nFOR THE AVOCADO-TOMATO SALSA\n\n1 large avocado, peeled, pitted, and diced\n\n1/2 cup diced seeded tomatoes, from 1 to 2 tomatoes\n\n1 small shallot, minced (about 2 tablespoons)\n\n1 clove garlic, minced\n\n1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced\n\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, from 1 lime\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground cumin\n\n1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro\n\nFOR THE BURRITOS\n\n4 large eggs\n\n1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika\n\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 lb spicy sausage (such as chorizo, Italian, or anything you like), removed from casings\n\n1-1/3 cups (6 oz) shredded Monterey Jack cheese\n\n4 (10-in) burrito-size flour tortillas\n\nVegetable oil", 
		instructions: "\n\nMake the Avocado-Tomato Salsa: Place all of the ingredients in a medium bowl and mix to combine. Set aside.\n\nIn a medium bowl, whisk the eggs with the smoked paprika and salt. Set aside.\n\nHeat a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage from the pan to a plate, leaving the drippings in the pan. Reduce the heat to low. Add the eggs and scramble until just cooked through. Transfer the eggs to a plate. Clean the pan (you'll use it again).\n\nAssemble the burritos: Spoon about 1/4 cup of the avocado-salsa onto each tortilla (you'll have a little leftover salsa; that's for the cook!), followed by a quarter of the sausage, a quarter of the eggs, and 1/3 cup cheese. Fold in the sides of the tortilla over the filling and roll, tucking in the edges as you go.\n\nLightly coat the pan with oil and set over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the burritos are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the burritos over and continue cooking, covered, until golden, a few minutes more. Serve warm.\n\nMake Ahead: The burritos may be assembled a few hours ahead of time, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated, before cooking. To reheat leftover burritos, wrap in foil and warm in a 350°F oven for about 15 minutes. (They won't be as crisp as they are fresh out of the pan, but they reheat well.)",

		description:
			'With a crisp yet chewy crust, this homemade Margherita pizza will rival your favorite pizzeria.',
		recipe: "\n\n1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, preferably San Marzano\n\n3 medium garlic cloves, minced\n\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 teaspoon sugar\n\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\nFlour, for stretching the dough\n\n2 (12-oz) homemade pizza doughs\n\n8 oz fresh mozzarella, not packed in water, cubed\n\n1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\n\n1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh basil, lightly packed\n\n1 tablespoon cornmeal, for baking", 
		instructions: "\n\nMake the Sauce: In a medium bowl, stir together the tomatoes, garlic, salt, sugar, pepper, and oil. (Alternatively, for a completely smooth sauce, you can blend the ingredients in a small food processor or blender.)\n\nPreheat the oven to 500°F and set an oven rack in the bottom position. Dust a 13x18-inch baking sheet with half of the cornmeal.\n\nOn a lightly floured surface, using your hands, stretch and press one ball of dough into an 11-inch round. Transfer the dough to the cornmeal-dusted baking sheet, and gently stretch it out again so that it maintains its shape.\n\nSpread ¼ cup + 2 tablespoons of the sauce over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Slide the baking sheet into the oven and bake for 7 minutes, until the crust is partially cooked. Remove from the oven, and scatter half of the mozzarella cubes over the sauce, followed by half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Slide the pan back into the oven and cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 4 minutes more. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Sprinkle with the basil and slice. Repeat with the remaining pizza dough and ingredients. (If you'd like to bake the two pizzas at the same time, you can fire up two ovens. Or, if you don't mind the crust a little thicker, you can form the two dough balls into 8x12-inch rectangles and place them side by side on the baking sheet.)\n\nNote: This recipe makes enough sauce for 4 (11-inch) pizzas. Refrigerate extra sauce for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 3 months.",

		instructions: "\n\nMake the dressing: Combine all dressing ingredients in a food processor and blitz to blend.\n\nPlace all of the salad ingredients except for the cheese in a large bowl. Right before serving, add about half of the dressing and toss well. Add more dressing little by little as necessary; be sure to dress greens very generously, otherwise salad will be bland. Toss in the cheese, then taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.\n\nNote: Ricotta salata is an Italian sheep's milk cheese that has a salty, slightly tangy flavor, almost like a dry Italian feta. It is not the same as the wet ricotta in the tub. You can find it at Whole Foods, gourmet grocers or specialty cheese shops.",

		name: 'Cioppino (Fisherman’s Stew)',
		description: 'Brimming with fresh seafood in a tomato and wine broth that tastes like the sea, cioppino is a delicious Italian-American fish stew.',
		recipe: '\n\n6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided\n\n2/3 cup finely chopped shallots, from about 3 shallots\n\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1 cup white wine, such as Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, etc.\n\n1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes\n\n2 (8 oz) bottles clam juice\n\n2 teaspoons sugar\n\n1-3/4 teaspoons salt, divided\n\n1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes\n\n1/2 teaspoon dried oregano\n\n7 sprigs fresh thyme, plus 1 teaspoon fresh chopped thyme\n\n1-1/2 pounds firm-fleshed fish fillets, such as halibut, cod, salmon, snapper, etc., cut into 2-inch pieces\n\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n\n1-1/2 pounds (about 18) littleneck clams, scrubbed\n\n1-1/2 pounds extra large raw shrimp, peeled and deveined\n\nFresh chopped Italian parsley, for garnish (optional)',
		instructions: '\n\nPreheat the oven to 400°F and set an oven rack in the middle position. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and set aside.\n\nIn a large pot, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute more. Do not brown.\n\nAdd the wine and increase the heat to high. Boil until the wine is reduced by about half, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\nAdd the crushed tomatoes, clam juice, sugar, 1 teaspoon of the salt, red pepper flakes, oregano, thyme sprigs, and 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 25 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, while the stew is simmering, toss the fish with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt. Arrange the fish on the prepared baking sheet and bake for about 10 minutes, or until just cooked through. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.\n\nWhen the stew is done simmering, remove and discard the thyme sprigs and stir in the butter. Add the clams and bring the stew back to a simmer. Cover and cook for about 6 minutes, until the clams have mostly opened. Gently stir in the shrimp and bring the stew back to a simmer; cover and cook until the shrimp are just cooked through and the clams are completely opened, about 5 minutes. Discard any unopened clams. Add the chopped thyme, then taste the stew and adjust seasoning, if necessary.\n\nDivide the warm fish into serving bowls. Ladle the stew over top, dividing the clams and shrimp evenly amongst the bowls. Garnish with parsley, if using, and serve with garlic bread, focaccia, or a baguette for sopping up the broth. And remember a second bowl for shells and plenty of napkins.\n\nMake Ahead: The stew — without seafood — can be made 2 days ahead and stored in the refrigerator, covered. When ready to serve, bake the fish and bring the stew to a simmer before adding the seafood.',

		instructions: '\n\nLine two baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.\n\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, coconut, kosher salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Set aside.\n\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, coconut oil, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Beat on medium speed for 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes more. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again.\n\nAdd the flour mixture and the water; mix on low speed until the flour is almost completely incorporated -- you should still be able to see some streaks of flour. Add the chocolate chips and mix until just combined. Use a spatula to give one final mix, making sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl.\n\nUse a 3-tablespoon cookie scoop to portion the dough into compact golf-ball sized mounds, spacing them on the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. (If you dont have a cookie scoop, you can use your hands. If the dough is too sticky to handle, refrigerate it until firm enough to roll.) Top each dough ball with a few flakes of sea salt (go easy - a little goes a long way). Place the baking sheets in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\n\nPreheat the oven to 350°F and set two oven racks in the middle positions.\n\nTransfer the baking sheets to the oven and bake for 14 to 17 minutes, until the cookies are puffed and the edges are slightly golden. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then use a spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. The cookies are best enjoyed fresh on the day they are made; if you dont plan to serve the whole batch, see instructions below to freeze the dough balls for longer storage.\n\nFreezer-Friendly Instructions: Scoop the cookie dough into balls, let set on a baking sheet in the freezer for about 30 minutes or until very firm, then place in a sealable bag and press out as much air as possible. Bake as needed directly from the freezer. (Allow 1 to 2 minutes longer in the oven.) To freeze after baking: Let the cookies cool completely and store in an airtight container separating layers with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Before serving, remove the cookies from the container and let them come to room temperature.',
